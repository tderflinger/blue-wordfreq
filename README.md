# blue-wordfreq

Word frequency list for Czech, Greek, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Romanian, Polish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Swedish with English translations.
Ideal for second language acquisition and language learning. The lists contain the 1000 most common words in each language.

Based on [wordfreq](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq), translated using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator).

Demo site: https://blue-wordfreq.netlify.app

## Transliteration

For the Greek language there is a transliteration offered for each word in brackets. The transliteration
system is aimed at preserving etymology. Thus, it differs a bit from the standard transliteration in
[ISO 843](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_843). For example, "Î²" is transliterated as "b" and not "v" as in ISO 843.

The transliteration of Korean follows the National Institute of Korean Language guidelines on Romanization of Korean.
